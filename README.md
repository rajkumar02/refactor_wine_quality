# Wine Quality Analysis
In this code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.

The code in this notebook first renames the columns of the dataset and then calculates some statistics on how some features may be related to quality ratings.
